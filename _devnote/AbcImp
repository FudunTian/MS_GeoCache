Options:                                                                   
-rpr/ reparent      DagPath                                                 
                    reparent the whole hierarchy under a node in the        
                    current Maya scene                                      
-ftr/ fitTimeRange                                                          
                    Change Maya time slider to fit the range of input file. 
-rcs / recreateAllColorSets                                                 
                    IC3/4fArrayProperties with face varying scope on        
                    IPolyMesh and ISubD are treated as color sets even if   
                    they weren't written out of Maya.                       
-ct / connect       string node1 node2 ...                                  
                    The nodes specified in the argument string are supposed to be the names of top level nodes from the input file.                       
                    If such a node doesn't exist in the provided input file, awarning will be given and nothing will be done.                             
                    If Maya DAG node of the same name doesn't exist in the    current Maya scene,  a warning will be given and nothing will be done.      
                    If such a node exists both in the input file and in the   current Maya scene, data for the whole hierarchy from the nodes down        
                    (inclusive) will be substituted by data from the input file, and connections to the AlembicNode will be made or updated accordingly.    
                    If string "/" is used as the root name,  all top level  nodes from the input file will be used for updating the current Maya scene. 
                    Again if certain node doesn't exist in the current scene, a warning will be given and nothing will be done.                           
                    If a single node is specified and it exists in the Maya scene but doesn't exist in the archive, children of that node will be connected to the children of the archive.

-m  / mode          string ("open"|"import"|"replace")                
                    Set read mode to open/import/replace (default to import)
-ft / filterObjects "regex1 regex2 ..."

-eft / excludeFilterObjects "regex1 regex2 ..."                          
                    Selective exclude cache objects whose name matches with
